# Login with MFA

A modern React application implementing a login system with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), signup flow, and role-based dashboard. It features a responsive UI with Tailwind CSS, an interactive particle background using tsParticles (hover trails, click bursts, parallax), and Cypress tests for validation.

## Features
- Login with email and password validation
- MFA verification using a mock 6-digit code
- Signup flow with basic validation
- Role-based access control (read-only vs read-write)
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Cypress tests for key scenarios
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Interactive particle background with hover trails, click bursts, and parallax effects

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher (LTS recommended)
- **npm**: Included with Node.js
- **Git**: To clone the repository
- **Cypress**: For running tests (installed via npm)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohitSingh5632/login-mfa.git
   cd login-mfa

## Note to decision maker 

I’m excited to share my React login with MFA application. It features a responsive UI with Tailwind CSS, an interactive particle background, a role-based dashboard, and three Cypress tests (invalid email, short password, successful login). The repository is at:

https://github.com/RohitSingh5632/login-mfa

Clone it, run `npm install`, then `npm start`. Use `npx cypress open` for tests. The README has full instructions. I’m happy to provide a demo or discuss further.

Best,
Rohit Singh
